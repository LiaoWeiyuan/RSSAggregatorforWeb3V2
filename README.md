## What is RSS or Reader Services?

RSS is a standard for contents feeds. Any website supporting this standard can be permissionless aggregated to RSS Reader Service or Apps.

"RSS to Reader" is just like "ERC-20 to Uniswap".

## How to use ðŸ¥© RAW? Just 4 steps.
1. [Download](RAW.opml) the the latest RAW.opml file from this repo.
2. Choose your favorite RSS service or apps. (I strongly recommend [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) as a frest start because it's totally free and [open sourced](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire).)
3. Import this OPML to your apps/services.
4. Syncing and Done!

## How to find/add new feeds?

Medium, Github, Substack, Mirror, Ghost are natively support RSS.

For example,

- GitHub: Appending ".atom" to most links, e.g. https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases.atom
- Substack: Appending "/feed" to link, e.g. https://0xsoros.substack.com/feed
- Mirror: Appending "/feed/atom" to link, e.g. https://ens.mirror.xyz/feed/atom
- Ghost: Appending "/rss" to link, e.g. https://fuel-labs.ghost.io/rss/
- Medium: Adding "/feed" after medium.com, e.g. https://medium.com/feed/anomanetwork
